# JVSVEML6070
> Node.js package for the Vishay VEML6070 UVA Light Sensor, written in TypeScript.

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 14 or later (v14.15.3 was used during development; other versions have not been tested)
* [Vishay VEML6070 UVA Light Sensor with I<sup>2</sup>C Interface]() connected to for example a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org)

## Dependencies
This package only depends on the [`i2c-bus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i2c-bus) package. Please refer to the `package.json` file for a list of development dependencies.

## Documentation
[TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org) is used throughout the code. The `docs` directory contains the documentation automatically generated by [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org).

Thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), you can quickly browse the documentation [here](https://jorisvervuurt.github.io/jvsveml6070).

## Usage
***Important note**: depending on the breakout board or custom implementation you use, you may need to provide a custom <sup>R</sup>SET resistor value (in kΩ, defaults to 270kΩ) and/or I<sup>2</sup>C bus number (defaults to 1). Please refer to the [Vishay VEML6070 datasheet](https://www.vishay.com/docs/84277/veml6070.pdf), [Vishay VEML6070 Application Note](https://www.vishay.com/docs/84310/designingveml6070.pdf) and this package's documentation for more information about configuration options and other usage notes.*

The API is mostly asynchronous; most functions return a `Promise` that resolves when the function has finished successfully. This means that you'll need to use `.then` / `.catch` or `async` / `await`. The `examples` directory contains examples that demonstrate both approaches.
